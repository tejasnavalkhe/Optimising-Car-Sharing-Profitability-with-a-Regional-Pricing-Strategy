# Optimising Car Sharing Profitability with a Regional Pricing Strategy

## Description:
The dissertation project is a component of my master's degree in MSc Data Science (Specialising in Artificial Intelligence). I served as a Data Scientist Intern at Co Wheels Car Club from April 23, 2024, to August 15, 2024.

## Project Objectives:
1. **Analyse Usage and Demand Patterns:** Examine the extensive trip data available in Co-Wheels’ booking system (TripIQ) to identify patterns in vehicle usage and demand across different locations and times.
2. **Design and Develop a Pricing Model and Tool:**
     1. Create a pricing model that incorporates fixed and variable costs, including fuel and electricity, to determine optimal hourly and daily rates for different locations and times.
     2. Develop a straightforward tool that allows Co-Wheels to input various cost factors and receive tailored pricing options based on location, demand, and seasonal variations.   
4. **Evaluate Seasonal and Temporal Variations:** Assess the impact of seasonal changes and time-of-day variations on car-sharing demand and integrate these factors into the pricing model.
5. **Assess Profitability and Utilisation Impact:** Model potential outcomes of different pricing strategies to evaluate their impact on profitability and vehicle utilisation rates in various locations.
6. **Validate pricing tool:** Test the pricing tool with real-world data to ensure its accuracy and effectiveness in optimising Co-Wheels’ pricing strategy.
